In order to win a round, a team must eliminate the opposing team or complete their team-specific spike objective. First team who reaches 13 rounds, wins the game. The game starts in a lobby, where players have to lock in their Agent. The lobby lasts for 80 seconds or until everyone has locked in their Agent. Only one of each Agent can be selected on each team and players cannot see which Agent has been picked on the opposing team until the first Buy Phase. The Buy Phase occurs before each round and lasts for 30 seconds. During Buy Phase, most areas of the map are inaccessible and the two teams cannot meet each other. Therefore, Attackers cannot enter sites and are only limited to areas near their spawn zone, while the Defenders can move freely between sites, but not further than that. Players are also allowed to buy weapons, shields, and abilities during this phase.
